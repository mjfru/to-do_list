# to-do_list
My first attempt at a CRUD application in MERN, refactored a few times and styled. A simple yet functional To-Do list.
A user can add a task, check it off, and/or delete it entirely from the list.
This is the first time I really tried to apply some kind of styling to a MERN project using CSS and BootStrap.
